automatic image downloader for toppicks Mod for slyk-1-hd skin

save toppicks.py to any location you like

set a crontimer to run it daily (early morning best)

command : /usr/bin/python /path/to/toppicks.py

This now works as it should.

grantdavey91 will be updating the images periodically.. i'd suggest setting the cron timer daily at some random time in the morning.

TopPicks2.sh is an automatic downloader from 3 different sources.. it's not perfect as it doesn't have the sky channel logs on some of the images, but it does mean you get fresh images each day (or each time you run it). It is standalone and does not require any other files from this repo to run.
